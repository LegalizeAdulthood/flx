Changes for V2.6:
16.04.27	A couple of bugfixes.  Changed license to BSD.

Changes for V2.5:
00.08.24	Readline support for DOS now appears to be working,
		thanks to a newer version of DJGPP.  It needs to
		be checked out a bit more, though, and there
		still seem to be some oddities.

Changes for V2.4:
00.01.16	Added upper limit check on INIT to hook command so
		we don't try to hook an INIT that extends into the
		space needed for the bootstrap.  This duplicates
		a check that exists in hook.sav.
00.01.18	Have "clean" display current dir and filename 
		even if not -verbose, but all on a single line.
00.01.23	Fix calculation of RE count in fileseek, which was
		causing disk block out of range errors sometimes.

Changes for V2.3:
00.01.02	Fixed eof calculation for RMS fixed files (-rf switch)
		Added support for RX50 format 5.25 inch floppy access
		in Linux.  Added code to get size for raw disks
		under Linux, so the -Size switch is no longer needed.
		Changed date display format to use 4 digit years, and
		fix some Y2K bugs.  :-(
00.01.04	Fixed an elusive malloc bug.
00.01.08	Fixed RX50 I/O.

Changes for V2.2:
99.12.02	Bugfix in RMS mode "get" for 32 bit int targets.
		Use fgets instead of gets in scancmd.

Changes for V2.0:

- bugfix in protect command: allow file protection code changes even
if P bit is set (as RSTS does)

- bugfix in rename: disallow rename/replace if new file name == old
name (previous code would delete the file and then crash)

- bugfix in hook command for environments with 32-bit integers

- fix platform.h so it may work better in Alphas (not tested for lack
of hardware)

- change abort handler to use setjmp/longjmp so failure no longer
exits but goes back to command prompt if in prompting mode

- added -noprotect as synonym for -unprotect

- bugfix in list -summary: print correct ppns in per-directory summary
line.

- added clean (rebuild)

- added -odt and -offset to hook command.

- bugfix in hook command to set clustersize (for disks whose
clustersize is not always the same)

- bugfix in quota update if doing multiple directories since start of
program

- allow [n,*] and [*,*] for gfd and mfd in get and dump commands

- use GNU readline package, with command line recall including history
file.
