README file for FLX 1/11/2000

What you have here is the set of sources needed to build FLX, a
Makefile to do it, and documentation (in PostScript and the source in
MS Word format).

Note on the Makefile: it has been used both with Mips Ultrix "cc" and
with gcc (with DOS and with Linux), but "make proto" only works with
cc since gcc doesn't support the -protoi switch.  Don't worry about
that unless you change the sources in a way that affects the procedure
prototype declarations.  (If you do, edit the .h file of the same name
as the .c file to reflect the changed prototypes.)

As far as I know, everything that's described in flx.ps should work.
Let me know if you find problems.  (I'll admit that I haven't tested
all the cases.  For example, RDS0.0 support has had limited testing.
And I don't have a "large" disk to test large DCS support!)

I've had very little feedback on this program.  If you use it, even
if you have no comments on it, I'd appreciate a short note.  And of
course if you do have comments, bug reports, or suggestions, then
definitely let me know!
